1. What were your results from compare_cow_transport_algorithms? Which algorithm runs faster? Why?
    The greedy algorithm ran nearly a thousand times faster than the brute force algorithm.
    The brute force algorithm creates all possible sets of cows that work. The greedy only creates one set.
2. Does the greedy algorithm return the optimal solution? Why/why not?
    No it does not, it gives a fast and good estimate of the optimal but it is not necessarily the optimal solution.
    It does not create the best solution, it puts the best possible choice at each step.
    Because of that it is unable to create the best possible solution.
3. Does the brute force algorithm return the optimal solution? Why/why not?
    It does produce the optimal solution, because the algorithm creates all possible solutions and finds the best solution.
